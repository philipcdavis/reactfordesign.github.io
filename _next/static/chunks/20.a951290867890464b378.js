You don\'t need a C.S. degree. You don\'t need to know how to hack any mainframes.\n\nWith the terminal, you can open, move, rename, copy and delete files. Same with directories (folders). The terminal is the Finder app on steroids. File management is just the start. The terminal is the interface for a slew of power tools.\n\nYou can install and run programs.  \nYou can version files.  \nYou can read documentation offline.  \nYou can write scripts to automate tasks.  \nYou can edit programs.  \nYou can configure hidden OS settings.  \nYou can tunnel into servers.  \nYou can take full advantage of open source resources.  \n\nIf you\'re using React, you can quickly spin up applications and install design systems.\nIf you\'re using git you can contribute to the execution of your design work.  \n\nThe terminal is a powerful tool.  \nIt\'s a powerful tool for designers.  \nIt\'s a powerful tool for anyone.\n\n## Make it look nice\n<div class="img-lg">\n  <img src="./assets/terminal/colors.png" />\n</div>\n\nThe Terminal can also be a bit daunting.\nI recommend making it look nice first.\n[Download](https://github.com/philipcdavis/laurelin) a nice theme.\nExtract the zip file, and import it into your terminal.\n\nOpen Terminal.  \n`CMD` + `,` to open up settings.  \nImport the `.terminal` file and set it to default.  \nRestart the Terminal.  \n\nIf you aren\'t happy with the default monospace font, there are plenty of good options to choose from:  \n\nSF Mono (Pre-installed)  \n[Input](https://input.fontbureau.com/)  \n[Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata)  \n[Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono)  \n[Office Code Pro](https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro)  \n[PragmataPro (paid)](https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/)  \n[Operator (paid)](https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator)  \n[Cartograph (paid)](https://connary.com/cartograph.html)  \n\n## Starter Commands\nThe Terminal helps you move around and modify the file system.\nHere are 7 commands that are important as you get started:\n\n### 1. List  \u2014 `ls`\n`ls` shows the files and directories in your current directory.\n\n### 2. Change Directory  \u2014 `cd`\n`cd` is how you move around.  \n`cd ..` will take you to the parent directory.  \n`cd Documents` will take you into the `Documents` directory. For this to work, you need to be currently in a location that contains a `Documents` directory.\n\n### 3. Move  \u2014 `mv`\n`mv` is used to move files from one directory to another.  \n`mv file.txt new/file.txt` moves a file from your current directory to the `new` directory.  \n`mv file.txt new.txt` will rename `file.txt` to `new.txt`.\n\n### 4. Create  \u2014 `touch`\n`touch` is used to create files.  \n`touch hello.md` creates a file named `hello.md` in your current directory.\n\n### 5. Make Directory  \u2014 `mkdir`\n`mkdir` creates a directory.  \n`mkdir images` creates a directory named `images` in your current directory.\n\n### 6. Remove  \u2014 `rm`\n`rm` removes a file.  \n`rm -d` removes a directory.  \n`rm -rf node_modules` will recursively delete the `node_modules` directory and every file/directory inside of it. Most commands you run in your terminal are harmless. **Be careful with this command.** Deleted objects aren\'t stored in Trash, and there\'s no undo.\n\n### 7. Open  \u2014 `open`\n`open` will open a file in the using the default program for that file type.  \n`open index.html` will launch your default browser with the html page in the location bar.  \n`open README.md` will open up your default markdown editor.\n\n## Important Locations\nIf you\'re on a Mac some locations have a shorthand.\n\n`/` is shorthand for your root directory.  \n`~` is shorthand for your user directory.  \n`.` is shorthand for your current directory.  \n\nYou can change directory from any location into your user (`cd ~`) or root (`cd /`) directory by using these shorthand locations.\nAdditionally, `cd` without a provided location will move you into your user directory.\n\nYou can use a tool like [bashmarks](https://github.com/huyng/bashmarks) to save and visit commonly used directories.\n\nTyping long location names gets old. In addition to shorthand, you can autocomplete locations using `tab`.\n\n## Custom Prompts and Commands\nBy default your Terminal includes computer and user information in the prompt.\n\n```\nPhilips-MacBook:Documents philipdavis$\n```\n\nIt\'s common to remove this and replacing it with the current location followed by a `$` sign.\n\n```\nDocuments $\n```\n\nTo do this, we need to edit a `.bash_profile` file (`.zprofile` if you\'re running MacOS Catalina) which allows us to customize our terminal further.\nThe `.bash_profile` file is located in the home `~` directory. If you run ls and you don\'t see it, it\'s because it\'s a dot file.\nDot files are hidden by default, but we can see them if we add parameters to our `ls` command.\n\nParameters for terminal commands are often passed after a `-` dash. `ls -alhG` shows you all files (including dot files) in an easier to scan format, with file size and colorized folders.\n\nThis is what the normal `ls` looks like.\n<div class="img-lg">\n  <img src="./assets/terminal/list.png" />\n</div>\nAnd now with the additional parameters.\n<div class="img-lg">\n  <img src="./assets/terminal/list-formatted.png" />\n</div>\n\nIf you don\'t see a `.bash_profile` in your home directory, you will need to create it.\n\n```\ntouch .bash_profile\n```\n\nOnce you have the file you can open it in a text editor.\n```\natom .bash_profile\n```\n\nOnce the file is opened, you can add the following string to replace the prompt cruft (computer name, location and user) with the location and a money `$` sign.\n\n```\nexport PS1="\\W \\$ "\n```\n\nIn addition, instead of remembering all the parameters for `ls -alhG` you can add an alias so that `ls` uses it by default.\n\n```\nalias ls="ls -alhG"\n```\n\nSave the `.bash_profile` file, run `source ~/.bash_profile` and then restart the terminal to start using the new settings.\n\nYou can create aliases for any commands that you commonly use.\nI\'ve created aliases for scaffolding react applications, and starting node applications. Here\'s what your `.bash_profile` might look like after you\'ve added your own custom aliases.\n\n```\nexport PS1="\\W \\$ "\nalias ls="ls -alhG"\nalias ns="npm start"\nalias cra="create-react-app"\n```\n\n## The Power Tools\n<div class="img-sm">\n  <img src="./assets/terminal/logos.png" />\n</div>\nIn additional to basic shell commands there are a number of powerful tools that allow you do more in your terminal. I\'ve listed a few below. Each takes time to learn. Each has something valuable to offer.\n\n**[git](https://git-scm.com/)** for versioning and collaboration.  \n**[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** or **[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)** for installing and versioning node modules.  \n**[homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** for installing programs and applications.  \n**ssh** for tunneling into servers.  \n**[vim](https://www.vim.org/docs.php)** for editing files in the terminal.  \n**[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)** for scaffolding react applications\n\n## Piping and Chaining\nBy default, output from your terminal is displayed in your terminal. You can reroute the output of a command to another file or to your clipboard by using the pipe command `|`.\n\n\n```\nbase64 file.jpg | pbcopy\n```\n\nHere we are running `base64` on an image which converts it to a [data URI](https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/). We are then copying the data URI to our clipboard. `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` are the commands to copy and paste in terminal.\n\nYou can use the `&&` operator to chain commands. This is useful when you need to wait for commands to execute. The `&&` operator acts as a queue. If the first command successfully executes the second will begin running.\n\n```\nnpm install && atom . && npm start\n```\n\nHere, when `npm install` is finished, atom will open with the current directory loaded and then `npm start` will run.\n\n\n## sudo GoForthAndH4ck.exe\nThe terminal is a powerful application but it doesn\'t need to feel intimidating.\nIf you have questions about using the terminal, or just want some guidance getting set up, please [reach out](https://twitter.com/philipcdavis) to me.\n'}}]);
